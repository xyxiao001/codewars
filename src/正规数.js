/*
A Hamming number is a positive integer of the form 2i3j5k, for some non-negative integers i, j, and k.

Write a function that computes the nth smallest Hamming number.

Specifically:

The first smallest Hamming number is 1 = 203050
The second smallest Hamming number is 2 = 213050
The third smallest Hamming number is 3 = 203150
The fourth smallest Hamming number is 4 = 223050
The fifth smallest Hamming number is 5 = 203051
The 20 smallest Hamming numbers are given in example test fixture.

Your code should be able to compute all of the smallest 5,000 (Clojure: 2000) Hamming numbers without timing out.
